For bugs and feedback you may report them in the [Contact Us](https://reformatme.com/contact-us/) directly on the website.

Public issues and bugs may be reported formally tracked in the github repo for the documentation. You may submit a bug/issue/request [there](https://github.com/lastlink/docs.reformatme.com/issues/new) if you wish it to be publicly tracked.
